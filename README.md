# java-jenkins
I have created a Java Maven application and deployed on an EC2 instance using a Jenkins Pipeline.
1. aws (EC2 instances, Security Groups).
2. Docker (Dockerfile, docker-compose, DockerHub).
3. Jenkins (Jenkinsfile, Shared-Library, Multi-Branch Pipeline, Automatically Incrementing the version number).
4. Configured a GitLab repository to use a webhook for continuous integration and deployment.
5. Git.
